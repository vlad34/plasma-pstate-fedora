# Intel P-state and CPUFreq Manager Widget

## What it is
Intel P-state and CPUFreq Manager is a KDE Plasma widget in order to control 
the frequencies of Intel CPUs and their integrated GPUs for any modern Intel 
Processors running in 
[Active Mode with HWP](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.12/admin-guide/pm/intel_pstate.html#active-mode-with-hwp) 
or 
[Active Mode Without HWP](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.12/admin-guide/pm/intel_pstate.html#active-mode-without-hwp). 
It can also manage the processor's energy consumption through Energy-Performance 
Preference (EPP) knob (if supported) or the Energy-Performance Bias (EPB) knob 
(otherwise).

Furthermore, it allows you to interact with the following vendor specific settings

1. [Dell's Thermal Management Feature](https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/ba/en/babsdt1/dell-command-power-manager-v2.2/userguide_dell/thermal-management?guid=guid-c05d2582-fc07-4e3e-918a-965836d20752&lang=en-us) 
through [libsmbios library](https://github.com/dell/libsmbios).

2. LG Gram laptop [Battery care limit](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/laptops/lg-laptop.rst#battery-care-limit), [USB charge](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/laptops/lg-laptop.rst#usb-charge) and [Fan mode](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/laptops/lg-laptop.rst#fan-mode) features (on kernel 4.20 and higher).

## What it isn't
This is just a GUI widget and it is not meant to replace 
[TLP](https://linrunner.de/en/tlp/tlp.html), [powertop](https://01.org/powertop) or 
any other power management / energy consumption service. It is meant just to 
provide quick access to ``sysfs`` settings related to Intel Processors and 
in fact it can run on top of TLP.

## Why
As the trend in modern laptops continues to be more CPU power in more slim 
chassis design and as the software and becomes more demanding, it is becoming 
harder to find a combination of power performance and/or energy consumption 
settings to fit all your daily tasks that require different levels of 
performance. 

This widget's purpose is to expose to the user hardware and kernel settings
that may be useful in cases you need to adjust such a setting from the 
comfort of your graphical interface using point and click or tap interactions 
even in cases that a keyboard isn't available.

## How to install
First of all you need to be in sudoers' group. After that you can just clone 
the code and install it using the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/frankenfruity/plasma-pstate
sudo dnf install cmake extra-cmake-modules kf5-plasma-devel kf5-ki18n kf5-ki18n-devel qt5-qtquickcontrols2-devel qt5-qtquickcontrols2
cd plasma-pstate
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
sudo make install

cd ..
sudo cp ./src/plasma_pstate.policy /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/
sudo chmod 644 /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/plasma_pstate.policy
```

**Notice:** If your processor doesn't support EPP(ie older generations without 
HWP), then you need also to install the ``x86_energy_perf_policy`` which (in 
case of Ubuntu 18.04 distros) is provided by the ``linux-tools`` package and 
can be installed using the following command

```
sudo apt install linux-tools-generic linux-tools-`uname -r`
```

## Custom profiles

A profile applies multiple settings at once.
